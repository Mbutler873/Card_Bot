# Card_Bot
This program was designed to create a bot that plays a strategically perfect game of "Goofspiel". The works by giving two players the cards Ace through King with an Ace being 1 and king being 13 (all values represented numerically in the program). Then prize cards are flipped over one by one for players to bid on. The player who plays the largest card out of their remaining cards wins the value of the prize card. Any card played is then discarded and steps are repeated until all cards have been played. The player with the highest score then wins. This program features the ability for the bot to play against users, or a second bot which plays very basic strategies. The bot versus bot matches can be simulated thousands of times in order to show the strenghts and weaknesses of the current bot.
